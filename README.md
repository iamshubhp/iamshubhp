👋 Hey there, I'm Shubh Patel!

👀 Some thing's about Me  
- I'm a Computer Science student at Algoma University with a deep passion for Machine Learning, AI, and Data Science. I'm currently focused on mastering Python and diving into the mathematical foundations—such as statistics and linear 
  algebra—that power modern ML algorithms.

🌱 Hmm so what am i Currently Learning?  
- **Python & Data Science Libraries**: Currently i am Strengthening my skills in Python with tools like NumPy, pandas, MatplotLib, scikit-learn, OOP in python and much more.  
- **Machine Learning & AI**: i am also exploring algorithms, neural networks, and other advanced AI techniques as i like to stay up to date with growing tech in the world.  
- **Mathematical Foundations**: Studying basic maths and also key concepts in statistics, probability, and linear algebra that underpin ML.

💼 ** Sometimes I wonder what I'm Working On but guess i figured it out**:   
- **Skill-Building Projects**:
- Engaging in hands-on projects and coding exercises that bridge theory and practice in ML and AI.  

- **Deepening ML Knowledge**:
- Continuously enhancing my understanding of the core math and techniques behind data science and machine learning.

🤝 I am also Looking to Collaborate On  
- **ML & AI Projects**: If you're working on innovative machine learning or AI solutions, I'd love to connect and collaborate. So you can feel free to hit me up on any opportunities.  
- **Data Science Initiatives**: I am also open to teaming up on projects that leverage data to drive actionable insights.
